                <h1>Our Research Project</h1>
            <p> Soil fertility is crucial for agricultural industries as it is one of the main components needed to grow crops for human consumption. It is the central key in world merchandise, as per the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 60% of the global population depends on agriculture for their survival on Earth(Lindsey et al,. 2020). Plants need sufficient nutrients in order to grow and produce products. 
            </p>
            <p>However, soil in certain areas is contaminated or low in nutrients for plants to grow. In other cases, the soil in the area is only applicable for certain types of crops, if you planted a wrong crop it might not only produce low quality product, it also might not produce a product at all, and the plant will die, worst case the soils’ nutrients will be destroyed so people need something that can identify the nutrients in the soil. 
            </p>
            <p>Knowing certain crops applicable for your soil is hard, as you don’t know how to identify it other than planting the plant, and going for a trial and error solution. This may seem alright, however, doing that requires a longer period of time to identify, and might destroy the soil. Therefore, we came up with a solution that utilizes smart monitoring sensors. This can assist farmers and individuals in the agriculture industry. The monitoring sensor is embedded with smart systems capable of collecting, analyzing, and providing results. The data is crucial as it will serve as the basis for determining the next steps in planting crops in that particular soil. Additionally, we included other plants that can naturally provide minerals to the soil without disrupting its ecosystem. This idea enables plants to be healthier without degrading the soil, thereby allowing for the cultivation of other crops that can mutually benefit each other's growth.
            </p>
            <p>Agriculture is one of the problems that we should be focusing on, as we depend on it in breathing, living and eating, and without it we will be in a serious problem. Therefore, we decided on creating something to help our declining food supply in a way that not just us can benefit but also our mother nature.
