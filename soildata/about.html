            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Soil fertility is crucial for agriculture, supporting the 60% of the global population that relies on farming for survival. However, many soils are nutrient-deficient or contaminated, complicating crop growth and necessitating better soil assessment methods. Traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient and harmful to the soil, prompting the need for smart monitoring sensors. These sensors collect and analyze soil data, guiding farmers in selecting suitable crops and preserving soil health. Additionally, integrating plants that naturally enrich the soil promotes sustainable agriculture, enhancing food security while benefiting the environment.</p>

            <h1>Our Topic</h1>
            <p>Our topic was selected among the Research Project topics in the course book, and it is under MSU-IIT Priority
                Research; Material Science; Smart Sensors for Material Stress Analysis: Developing advanced sensors for real-time monitoring of material stress and degradation. We choose this as the we want to explore the field that we think can benefit us in
                the long run. And as researchers with knowledge about technologies, we want to use our strengths to prevent 
                the further problems that we are experiancing in our world today, one of this is the environment. We hope that
                this may help our planet and economy.
